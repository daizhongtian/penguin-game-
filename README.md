This project is a C-based penguin board game that simulates a strategic game where multiple players place and move penguins on an ice floe board. The board is randomly initialized with different fish values, and players take turns to position and move their penguins to collect fish. The game supports saving and loading the state, allowing players to continue from where they left off. This project demonstrates core C programming techniques such as dynamic memory allocation, file I/O, and game state management.

future improvement:
Consider developing a GUI to replace or enhance the current command-line interface.

Integrate AI-controlled players for single-player mode or to complement multiplayer sessions: Iterate over each penguin of the current player. For each penguin, generate all valid moves (up, down, left, right) that lead to legal target positions. Evaluate each move using a state evaluation function, then choose the move with the highest score.
