This project is a C-based penguin board game that simulates a strategic game where multiple players place and move penguins on an ice floe board. The board is randomly initialized with different fish values, and players take turns to position and move their penguins to collect fish. The game supports saving and loading the state, allowing players to continue from where they left off. This project demonstrates core C programming techniques such as dynamic memory allocation, file I/O, and game state management.
